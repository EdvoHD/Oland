### Project - Setup
- GULP:
  Setting up our dev - environment with gulp and got a few dependencies to use SCSS and a localserver that refreshes on change in html, css or javascript files.
  
- Github: 
To make sharing our progress in the group much easier and clearer we use github. Basically so we can see who did what.

- Project idea and plans



### Milestone 1 - Sketch design 
- We settled on a minimalistic white design to keep it clean and to follow our brand pattern.
- Designed every single page before we started coding to have a clear goal.


### Milestone 2 - Static site setup. 
- Creating static page file.
    - Basically making my sketch design in code.
